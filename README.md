# Ad Click Prediction for Digital Marketing Optimization

# Project Overview
Developed a machine learning solution to predict ad click rates for digital marketing campaigns. This project demonstrates the application of data science in marketing analytics, focusing on helping businesses optimize their ad performance and ROI.
# Business Context
In digital advertising, accurately predicting ad performance is crucial for:
- Optimizing ad spend allocation
- Improving campaign effectiveness
- Maximizing return on investment (ROI)
- Making data-driven marketing decisions

# Technical Implementation
Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values using a strategic three-tier approach
- Engineered temporal features including 7-day and 14-day rolling averages
- Created comprehensive ad performance metrics
- Implemented categorical encoding for ad types and display locations

# Model Development
Built a Random Forest model incorporating strategically engineered features:
- Engineered temporal features: 7-day and 14-day rolling averages to capture historical patterns
- Ad visibility metrics (impressions - strongest natural predictor)
- Campaign metrics (cost, conversions)
- Content characteristics (headline lengths)

# Key Features
Input features include:
- Ad impressions and visibility metrics
- Historical click patterns (7 and 14-day rolling averages)
- Campaign cost and conversion data
- Content characteristics (headline lengths)

# Model Performance
The model provides:
- Click predictions for 1-2 weeks ahead
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance metrics (RMSE)
- Actionable insights for optimization

# Marketing Science Insights
